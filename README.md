# head_tail
pulling first and last line of file

1) Edit head_tail.py and change input_filename and output_filename
2) Ensure that head_tail.py is in the same directory as your desired input_file
3) Run code


1:
    Open in VS Code, text editor, IDE, or command line to edit lines 2 and 17 with the file names of your input file and output file.

2:
    If your head_tail.py is not in the same directory as input file, you will need to add additional code to search through directories to find the file. This simplifies it a bit :)

3:
    Either run in your IDE or using command line ("cd downloads"    "py head_tail.py")
    
    
    
    
    I hope this code helps in your scientific endeavors, feel free to use and edit :)
